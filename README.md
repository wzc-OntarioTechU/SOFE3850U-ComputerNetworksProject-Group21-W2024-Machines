# SOFE3850U Final Project VMs

This repository serves to synchronise the metadata of the virtual machines used in this project across group members. Since network adapters and other critical settings regarding networking and machine interfaces are stored in the metadata virtual box files rather than on the virtual disk images and that the virtual disk images are too large, the actual vdi files are excluded from this repository. For this reason, the packed version of this repository that does contain the ignored vdi files should be downloaded and then a `git pull` should be done to update the metadata files to most recent. **NOTE: since the vdi files are excluded, the internal contents of each vm are NOT SYNCHRONIZED!**
